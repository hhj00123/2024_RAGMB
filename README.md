# RAGMB
In our study, we established an RA-originated gut microbial biobank (RAGMB). For easy access to the public, we deposited 601 representative strains at the China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center (CGMCC) of the International Depositary Authority (IDA). The RAGMB covered extensively both high and low-abundant RA gut microbes and included 4 rare species from the phylum Synergistota. We defined an RA core gut microbiome composed of 20 bacterial species, and correlated core species with RA clinically used indices and prognosis. We also found that two core microbial species Mediterraneibacter tenuis and Eubacterium rectale exacerbated host inflammatory responses in mice.
More information (the taxonomy and 16S rRNA gene sequences; phenotypic and genomic descriptions for all new species) regarding the 280 species is accessible at the RAGMB website (https://www.nmdc.cn/ragmb/).
